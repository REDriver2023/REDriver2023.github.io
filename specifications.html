           Article 38: Motor vehicle signal lights and non-motor vehicle signal lights indicate:
          (1) When the green light is on, vehicles are allowed to pass, but turning vehicles shall not hinder the passing of straight vehicles and pedestrians that are being released.
          (2) When the yellow light is on, vehicles that have crossed the stop line can continue to pass;
          (3) When the red light is on, vehicles are prohibited from passing. When the red light is on, vehicles turning right can pass without hindering the passage of vehicles or pedestrians.

           Article 44:  Where there are two or more motorized lanes in the same direction on the road, the left side is the fast lane and the right side is the slow lane. Motor vehicles traveling in a fast lane shall drive at the speed specified in the fast lane, and those that have not reached the speed specified in the fast lane shall drive in a slow lane. Motorcycles should drive in the rightmost lane. If there are traffic signs indicating the driving speed, drive at the indicated driving speed. When a motor vehicle in a slow lane overtakes the preceding vehicle, it can borrow the fast lane to drive.
           Where there are two or more motor vehicle lanes in the same direction on the road, the motor vehicle that changes lanes shall not affect the normal driving of the motor vehicle in the relevant lane.

On a road with no center line of the road or with only one motor vehicle lane in the same direction, when the vehicle in front meets the vehicle behind and sends an overtaking signal, if conditions permit, the speed should be reduced and the road should be made to the right.

    (2) Those who are preparing to enter the roundabout let motor vehicles already in the intersection go ahead;
    (3) When turning to the left, turn to the left of the center of the intersection. Turn on the turn signal when turning, and turn on the low beam when driving at night;
    (4) Pass in turn when encountering a release signal;
    (5) When the stop signal is encountered, stop outside the stop line in turn. If there is no stop line, stop outside the intersection;
    (6) When turning right when there is a car in the same lane waiting for the release signal, stop and wait in turn;
